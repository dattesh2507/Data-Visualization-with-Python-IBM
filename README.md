# **Data-Visualization-with-Python-IBM**


  # üìÑ Summary
  This course teaches how to present and visualize complex data in a manner that makes sense to people, and allows for insights to be easily seen and derived. This course makes use of several Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium, to explore Canadian immigration data. It also covers dashboard creation using Plotly Dash, with a Peer graded assignment combining the skills learned to analyse and report US domestic airline flights performance in a dashboard.
  
  üìë Main Topics
  
  - Introduction to Data Visualization Tools
  - Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
  - Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data
  - Dashboard creation using Plotly Dash.

üîë Key Skills Learned

-  Using Matplotlib to create various plots, including line plots, area plots, histograms, bar charts, and more.
- Applying advanced visualization tools to create waffle charts and word clouds.
- Using Seaborn with Matplotlib to generate attractive regression plots.
- Creating maps and visualizing geospatial data, using Folium.
- Using Plotly, Plotly.graph_objects, and Plotly express commands.
- Using Dash and basic Dash components (core and HTML).

# IBM Data Visualization Course Project: Automobile Statistics Dashboard using Dash

This project is the culmination of my work in the IBM Data Visualization course. It involves the creation of an interactive dashboard using the Dash framework and Plotly to visualize statistical data for an anonymous automobile company. The dashboard is structured into two distinct reports, each providing valuable insights into the company's performance.

## Project Structure

### 1. Yearly Automobile Sales Statistics

- **Yearly Average Automobile Sales (Line Chart):** Explore the overarching trend in annual automobile sales over the entire data period.

- **Chosen Year's Insights:**
  - **Total Monthly Automobile Sales (Line Chart):** Dive into the sales performance on a monthly basis for the selected year.
  
  - **Average Monthly Automobile Sales by Vehicle Type (Bar Chart):** Gain insights into the performance of each vehicle type, showcasing their monthly averages.
  
  - **Total Advertisement Expenditure by Vehicle (Pie Chart):** Understand the allocation of advertisement expenditure among different vehicle types.

### 2. Recession Period Statistics

- **Average Automobile Sales during Recession (Line Chart):** Visualize how the company performed during recession periods, providing a clear understanding of its resilience.

- **Average Number of Vehicles Sold by Vehicle Type (Bar Chart):** Analyze the sales distribution among various vehicle types during recession periods.

- **Total Expenditure Share by Vehicle Type during Recession (Pie Chart):** Explore the company's expenditure allocation during economic downturns, shedding light on resource management.

- **Effect of Unemployment Rate on Vehicle Type and Sales (Bar Chart):** Uncover the correlation between the unemployment rate and the performance of different vehicle types, providing a deeper understanding of market dynamics.
